Signal Temporal Logic
=====================

Coming soon:

    - STL definition (syntax and semantics)
    - Control from STL specifications (synthesis)

This Software
=============

This software is designed with the following goals in mind:

    - Provide a clean and **simple python interface** for dealing with STL formulas
    - Provide **high-quality implementations** of several state-of-the-art synthesis algorithms,
      including Mixed-Integer Convex Programming (MICP) and gradient-based optimization.
    - Make it easy to design and evaluate **new synthesis algorithms**. 
    - Provide a variety of **benchmark scenarios** that can be used to test the scalability
      of new synthesis/control methods. 

Our target audience includes students learning about STL, researchers designing new STL
synthesis methods, and practictioners using STL to control robotic and other real-world systems.

If this software is helpful to you, if you have a new synthesis method you would like to see
included in the package, or if you have any questions, feel free to `reach out`_.
