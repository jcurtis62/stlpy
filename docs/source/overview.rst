This Software
=============

**pySTL** is a python library for control from Signal Temporal Logic (STL) specifications. 

This software is designed with the following goals in mind:

    - Provide a :ref:`simple python interface<Defining STL Formulas>` for 
      dealing with STL formulas
    - Provide :ref:`high-quality implementations<Solving Control Problems>` 
      of several state-of-the-art synthesis algorithms, including Mixed-Integer
      Convex Programming (MICP) and gradient-based optimization.
    - Make it easy to design and evaluate 
      :ref:`new synthesis algorithms<Write Your Own Solver>`. 
    - Provide a variety of :ref:`benchmark scenarios<Benchmarks>`
      that can be used to test new algorithms.

If this software is helpful to you, if you have a new synthesis method you would like to see
included in the package, or if you have any questions, feel free to `reach out`_.
